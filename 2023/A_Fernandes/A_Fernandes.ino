  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

  This is an example for the BMP085 Barometric Pressure & Temp Sensor

  Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit BMP085 Breakout 
  ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/391

  These pressure and temperature sensors use I2C to communicate, 2 pins
  are required to interface
